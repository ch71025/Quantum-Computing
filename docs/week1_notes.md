# Week 1 Notes: Quantum Foundations

## Date: [Today's Date]

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Qubit Mathematics
- State vector: |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
- α, β are complex numbers (probability amplitudes)
- |α|² + |β|² = 1 (normalization condition)

### 2. Superposition
- Quantum system can be in multiple states at once
- Measurement collapses to definite state
- Probability = |amplitude|²

### 3. Dirac Notation
- |0⟩: ket for state 0 (vector [1, 0]ᵀ)
- |1⟩: ket for state 1 (vector [0, 1]ᵀ)
- ⟨ψ|: bra (conjugate transpose of ket)

## Questions to Explore
1. How do complex numbers affect interference?
2. What's the physical implementation of qubits?
3. How does entanglement work mathematically?
